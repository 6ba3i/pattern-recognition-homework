# Pattern Recognition Homework

This repository contains a series of homework assignments for a university course on **Pattern Recognition**, using the **Iris dataset** for practical classification tasks. The goal is to explore various machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and understand classification principles.

## üìÅ Contents

- `hw 1/`: Threshold-based classification using Sepal Length and ROC curve.
- `hw 2/`: Naive Bayes classification and performance evaluation using ROC and cross-validation.
- `hw 3/`: Logistic Regression for multiclass classification using One-vs-Rest and Softmax (Multinomial).
- `hw 4/`: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and comparison with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes using F1-score and ROC curves.

## üß† Techniques Covered

- Binary and Multiclass Classification
- Threshold-based Classification
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
- Logistic Regression (OvR and Softmax)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
